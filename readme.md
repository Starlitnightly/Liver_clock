## Abstract

### Background aims

Aging is accompanied by a decline in cellular [proteome](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/proteome) [homeostasis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/homeostasis), mitochondrial, and metabolic function. [Mesenchymal stromal cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/mesenchymal-stem-cell) (MSC) therapies have been reported to extend lifespan and delay some age-related pathologies, yet the anti-aging rate and mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated the effects and mechanism by transplantation of stem cells from human exfoliated [deciduous teeth](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/deciduous-teeth) (SHED) into the naturally aged mice model.

### Methods

SHED were cultured in vitro and injected into mice by caudal vein. The in vivo imaging uncovered that SHED labeled by DiR dye mainly migrated to the liver, spleen, and lung organs of wild-type mice. As the main metabolic organ and SHED homing place, the liver was selected for [proteomics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/proteomics) and aging clock algorithm (LiverClock) analysis, which was constructed to estimate the proteomic pattern related to liver age state.

### Results

After 6 months of continuous SHED injections, the liver proteomic pattern was reversed from senescent (∼30 months) to a youthful state (∼3 months), accompanied with upregulation of hepatocytes marker genes, anti-aging [protein Klotho](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/klotho-protein), a global improvement of liver functional pathways proteins, and a dramatic regulation of ribosomal and mitochondrial proteins, including upregulation of [translation elongation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/translation-elongation) and ribosome-sparing proteins Rpsa and Rplp0; [elongation factors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/elongation-factor) Eif4a1, Eef1b2, Eif5a; protein-folding chaperones Hsp90aa and Hspe1; ATP [synthesis proteins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/protein-synthesis) Atp5b, Atp5o, Atp5j; and downregulation of most [ribosomal proteins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/ribosome-protein), suggesting that the proteome homeostasis destruction and mitochondria dysfunction in the aged mice liver might be relieved after SHED [treatment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/therapeutic-procedure).

### Conclusions

SHED treatment could dramatically relieve the senescent state of the aged liver, affect ribosome component proteins and upregulate the ribosomal biogenesis proteins in the aged mice liver. These results may help understand the improvements and mechanisms of SHED treatment in anti-aging.
