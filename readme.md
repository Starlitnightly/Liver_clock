## Abstract

Aging is accompanied by a decline in cellular proteostasis, mitochondrial and metabolic function, and related to many degenerative diseases. Here we examined the effects of the stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) in a naturally aged mice. 6 months (from 24 to 30 months of age) of consecutive SHED injection could extend the life span, enhance the grip strength and increase the serum SOD activity. Further TMT-labeled proteomics of the vital metabolic organ liver uncovered that SHED treatment mainly affected the ribosomal and mitochondrial proteins, including upregulation of translation elongation and ribosome-sparing proteins Rpsa and Rplp0; elongation factors Eif4a1, Eef1b2, Eif5a; protein-folding chaperones Hsp90aa and Hspe1; ATP synthesis proteins Atp5b, Atp5o, Atp5j; and downregulation of ribosomal proteins Rps14, Rps3a1, Rps20, etc., suggesting that the proteome homeostasis destruction and mitochondria dysfunction might be relieved after SHED treatment. Finally, the aging clock algorithm (LiverClock) was constructed to estimate the liver age state, which was reversed from senescent (~30 months) to youthful state(~3 months) under SHED treatment. These results may help understand the improvements and mechanisms of SHED treatment in anti-aging.
